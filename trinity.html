<h1> Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It is a Liberal Arts college that was established in 1869.</p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="trinity-photo.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has a beautiful 125 acre campus that is filled with nature everywhere you look. As a student here I really love how many trees and plants there are around campus. With 49 majors and 61 minors Trinity offers a range of topics that will suit your intrest. </p> 
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the sense of community and friendliness that can be felt around the campus. I love how everyone is so nice and is willing to help anyone out. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because it is the only school in San Antonio that offers the major that I want, Chinese. I am very excited to be learning about the culture and language of China. I also chose Trinity because of the small school population. With a class size ratio of 9:1, you can really get close to your class mates and professors.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I hope to be majoring in  because I want to be a Interpreter. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
